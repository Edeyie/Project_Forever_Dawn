# Project_Forever_Dawn
Final Course Project Roy Carr Capstone
The Forever Dawn project is completed. In these few short weeks I have developed a web application to
assist with new players on the online adventure called “Forever Dawn”. Within the website players will
be able to get a head start on basics regarding Classes, Races, Weapons and soon Lore! Within the website 
players can also reach out for any assistance, guidance and concerns to the game and its growing community
